# br_addongen
A small little program for generating a blank GMOD LUA Addon.

What does this do exactly?

It generates a folder structure automatically based on the addon name you input. It also auto sets up an init file that properly
Includes and AddCSLua's all files to where the belong. Automatically. It has an option to create blank server, shared, and client lua files.
